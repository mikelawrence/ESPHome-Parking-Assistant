Use the ```config.yaml``` file above to configure the ESPHome-Parking-Assistant in ESPHome.

## STUSB4500 and TFMini External Components

ESPHome doesn't directly support either the STUSB4500 or the TFMini devices. I wrote code that allows ESPhome to support these devices using [External Components](https://esphome.io/components/external_components.html). 

For a more detailed description of these components have a look at my [repository](https://github.com/mikelawrence/ESPHome-Components).
